In the settings panel, you will find functionality to import and export podcasts.
This feature lets you import your saved podcasts from other apps, e.g. Pocket Casts.
Similarly, you can also export your podcasts from PodNotes to such apps.

## Importing

You can import podcasts by placing a `opml` file in your Obsidian vault.
Inside settings, PodNotes will automatically try to detect these, and suggest them.
Then you need only click _Import_ to add them to your saved feeds.

## Exporting

You can export your saved feeds to `opml` format.
First designate a file path to save to (or use the default), and click _Export_.
