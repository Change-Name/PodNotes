In the settings panel, you will find functionality to import and export podcasts.
This feature lets you import your saved podcasts from other apps, e.g. Pocket Casts.
Similarly, you can also export your podcasts from PodNotes to such apps.

## Importing

To import podcasts, follow these steps:

1. Go to the PodNotes settings in Obsidian.
2. Find the "Import" section.
3. Click the "Import OPML" button.
4. A file selection dialog will open. Choose your OPML file.
5. The selected podcasts will be imported into PodNotes.

## Exporting

You can export your saved feeds to `opml` format.
First designate a file path to save to (or use the default), and click _Export_.
