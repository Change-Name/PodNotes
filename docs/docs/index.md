The one goal for PodNotes is to make it easier to write notes on podcasts.

Here's the features that'll help you do that ðŸ‘‡.

## Features

- Track played episodes & playback progress
- API that can be used by plugins like [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/QuickAdd) or [Templater](https://github.com/silentvoid13/Templater). With it, you can get
    - Episode title

    - Episode URL
    - Episode podcast name
    - Episode publish date
    - A 'safe' filename for the episode (using the title)
