## Adding podcasts
You can add podcasts by searching for them in the podcast search box in settings.
This searches the iTunes podcast repository.

It is also possible to add custom podcast feeds by pasting the feed URL in the search box.
PodNotes will try to parse the feed, and if successful, will prompt you to add it to your saved feeds.


## Playlists
PodNotes can create playlists, which are lists of episodes.
For each playlist, you can specify a name and an icon.

The playlists are shown in the episode grid, represented by their icons.

By default, you will have a queue playlist and a favorites playlist.

You can delete playlists by pressing the trash bin icon next to the playlist name.
The icon will change to a checkmark, which should be pressed within a short duration to confirm the deletion.

## Episode list
The episode list is a dynamic view, which will change depending on your selection.

If you have no podcast selected, the episode list will show the latest episodes of all your saved feeds.

If you have a podcast selected, the episode list will show all episodes of that podcast.

And lastly, if you select a playlist, the episode list shows all episodes in that playlist.

## Context menu
You can right-click (desktop) or long-press (mobile) on an episode in the episode list to open the context menu.

The context menu will let you

- Play the episode
- Mark the episode as played
- Download / remove the episode
- Add / remove the episode to favorites
- Add / remove the episode to queue
- Add / remove the episode to a playlist

## Player
The player will automatically load and play the current episode.

Clicking on the epsiode image will toggle episode playback.

The player also features a progress bar, which you can use to seek to a specific time in the episode.
You can also press the buttons on the player to skip backwards or forwards in the episode.

Episode playback rate can be controlled by using the playback rate slider.
This is, by default, what you have set in the settings.
